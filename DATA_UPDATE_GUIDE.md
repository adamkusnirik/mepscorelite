# Data Update Guide for MEP Ranking System

**For Non-Technical Maintainers**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for updating the MEP (Member of European Parliament) activity data in the ranking system.

## üéØ Overview

The MEP Ranking system focuses on **10th parliamentary term (2024-2029)** data. Regular updates ensure the rankings reflect the most current parliamentary activities.

## üìÅ Data Update Folder

**Important**: All new data files must be placed in:
```
\data\parltrack\
```

This is the designated folder where the system looks for updated ParlTrack data files.

## üìã Step-by-Step Update Process

### Step 1: Download Latest ParlTrack Data

1. **Visit ParlTrack**: Go to [parltrack.org](https://parltrack.org)
2. **Download Required Files**: Look for these compressed files (.zst format):
   - `ep_mep_activities.json.zst` ‚Üê **Most Important** (MEP activities like speeches, amendments)
   - `ep_amendments.json.zst` (Amendment details)
   - `ep_votes.json.zst` (Voting records) 
   - `ep_meps.json.zst` (MEP biographical information)

3. **Save to Correct Folder**: Place all downloaded files in `\data\parltrack\`

### Step 2: Cross-Check MEP List ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

This step ensures accuracy of the data:

1. **Get Official MEP List**: Download the current MEP full list XML from European Parliament website
2. **Verify MEP Count**: Confirm the number matches current 10th term MEPs (~720 MEPs)
3. **Check for Changes**: Look for newly elected MEPs or those who have left office

### Step 3: Run the Data Update

#### Option A: Simple Method (Recommended)
- **Windows**: Double-click `run_update.bat`
- **Command Line**: Type `python run_update.py` and press Enter

#### Option B: PowerShell (Windows)
- Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"
- Navigate to the project folder
- Type `.\run_update.ps1` and press Enter

### Step 4: Monitor the Update Process

The update will show progress messages:
```
‚úÖ Decompressing ParlTrack files...
‚úÖ Ingesting MEP activities...
‚úÖ Processing amendments data...
‚úÖ Building Term 10 dataset...
‚úÖ Calculating scores...
‚úÖ Update complete!
```

**Typical Duration**: 5-15 minutes depending on data size

### Step 5: Verify Update Results

After the update completes, check:

1. **MEP Count**: Verify the number of MEPs matches expectations
2. **Recent Activity**: Check that recent parliamentary activities appear
3. **Profile Pages**: Test a few MEP profiles to ensure data updated
4. **Rankings**: Confirm ranking changes reflect recent activities

## üîÑ What Gets Updated
