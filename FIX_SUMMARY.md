# Flags and Logos Fix - August 16, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MEP Photo Loading Issue
- Problem: Photos were loading from local ./photos/ directory (empty)
- Solution: Changed to official European Parliament URLs
- File: public/js/explorer.js line 837
- Changed photoUrl from local path to https://www.europarl.europa.eu/mepphoto/

### 2. Dataset Country/Group Data Issue  
- Problem: All MEPs in datasets had Unknown country and group values
- Root Cause: Dataset generation was using placeholder values instead of reading from meps.db
- Solution: Created Python script to read correct data from database and update JSON files

## Datasets Fixed
- Term 8: Fixed 860 MEPs with proper country/group data
- Term 9: Fixed 875 MEPs with proper country/group data  
- Term 10: Fixed 719 MEPs with proper country/group data

## Results
- Country flag emojis display properly
- Group logos display correctly
- MEP photos load from official EP URLs
- No console errors
- Works across all terms (8, 9, 10)

## Files Modified
1. public/js/explorer.js - Fixed photo URL source
2. Dataset JSON files - Fixed country/group data (gitignored)

## Verification
- Visit https://mepscore.eu for all terms
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify flags and logos display in table and mobile view
